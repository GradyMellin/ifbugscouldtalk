# If Bugs Could Talk 
This is a fun website that I have been working on. I fully developed the site 
and my friend Alex and I have come up with the content. 
It is just a fun way to to practice and play with different html and css styles
The site is active although it is still a work in progress
you can check it out ifbugscouldtalk.com
